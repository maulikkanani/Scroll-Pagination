## Usage

The `mkscroll` method is called on scroll a window for example.

```javascript
	jQuery(window).mkscroll({
             limit:10,              
             total:100,             
         });
```
The `mkcroll` method have two compulsory object `limit` and `total`. `limit` is for a initial limit of your query. and `total` is a count of your total number of records.

The `mkcroll` method takes an optional object literal as a parameter for overriding the default options. An example of how this can be done is shown below.

```javascript
jQuery(window).mkscroll({
             limit:10,              
             total:100,             
             offset:5,              
             appendon:"#main",
